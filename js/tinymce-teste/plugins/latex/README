It does what it says: you write LaTeX code, it inserts an image rendered through Google Infographics API in your fav web rich text editor, you can try a demo here: http://www.diegocaponera.com/web/files/tiny_mce_latex_plugin.htm .

You can:

* Write new formulae;
* Edit existing ones;
* See preview of the code you are writing.
* It's a very simple thing, Google does all the work - buy me a coffee if you found this useful, and please tell me if you find any bug.

Installation
* Get the plugin;
* Unzip it into the plugins folder of TinyMCE;
* Wherever you startup a TinyMCE editor, register the plugin:
yourTextArea.tinymce({
    ...
    // General options
    theme : "advanced",
    plugins : "autolink,lists, ... ,latex",
    ...
    // Theme options
    ...
    // Put the plugin wherever you want!
    theme_advanced_buttons2 : "...,latex,|,...",
    
    ...
    
});
    
* You are done - go write a post about Zeta Function and Megan Fox now.
